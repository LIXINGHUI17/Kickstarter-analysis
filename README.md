## Overview of Project

    To deeply explore and do the visualization for different campaigns fared in relation to their launch 
    dates and their funding goals

### Purpose

    This chanllenge will give the analyst simply processes about whether launch date would influnece 
    outcomes for "theater", and the whether goals would influnce the outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

    Through line chart based on the "theater", the lines of success and failure are basically a contour, 
    which means when there are more successful projects, there will be more failed projects. Similarly, 
    when there are few successful projects, there will be fewer failed projects. However, in the summer time, 
    it shows more successful projects.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    
    The two lines show a symmetrical trend because this is a percentage-based analysis, since canceled 
    project is 0.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    
    In this simply project, I did not find any challenges and difficulties. The only thing I would like to 
    mentioned is that when I did the countifs, I found it was time-consuming. I do not know whether there 
    is a simply way to do it or not.

## Results

  What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    
    For the successful projects, there is obvious evidence that can prove there are more successful projects in the summer period than winter period.
    For the failed projects, there is no obvious evidence that the failed projects and canceled projects are related to time.

  What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   
    For subcategory "plays", we could conclude that goal has a clear impact on the project.

  What are some limitations of this dataset?
   
    When I do the analysis for outcomes based on goals, all canceled project are zero, need to figure it out whether it is correct, or they are missing value.

  What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    
    Analyst could do the pie chart for oucomes based on goals, it might more clear for the precentage data.
